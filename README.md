Hello, my name is Cem and I've been learning to code self-taught since spring 2023. 

Here you can find my first steps as a software developer. 
From smaller projects to (for me) larger projects, everything is here. 
This should serve as an example of my efforts so far. Up to now I have only programmed in Java, but I would like to change this for the year 2024
